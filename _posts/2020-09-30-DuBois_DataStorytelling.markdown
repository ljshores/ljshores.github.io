One hundred and twenty years ago W.E.B. Du Bois assembled a team and created an exhibit for the World’s Fair in Paris. His objective was to show the progress of African Americans 35 years after slavery through data visualization, photos, and artifacts, thus refuting prevailing beliefs of the time that blacks were subhuman. From a data perspective this is noteworthy because he was amongst the first sociologists to use engaging data visualizations and design to tell a story in service to social justice. From a life perspective this is interesting because 120 years later, black folks are still trying to prove our humanity; that our lives matter.

**Combatting Dominant Perceptions of Black Lives**  

Other than how sad and screwed up this reality is, Du Bois’s ‘American Negro Exhibit’ got me thinking about data storytelling and its limits. For context, Du Bois entered his exhibition on black life at a time when leading sociological thought pointed to the self-destruction and extinction of the race due to its inherent backwardness, violence, and inferiority. Most depictions of black and brown peoples of the world at these Fairs were of the exotic savage, placing these peoples in primitive villages in stark contrast to the modern industrial progress displayed in the other exhibits. These representations affirmed black and brown inferiority. So Du Bois aimed to tell a story with data that made the argument for the equality and sophistication of Black Americans despite living under Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery.  

The exhibit had two distinct parts that worked together to tell the entire story. Part I was a deep dive sociological study of ‘The Georgia Negro’. Georgia had the largest black population of any state at the time, and Du Bois and his team used it to illustrate Black progress since the Civil War. The second part of the exhibit, more national and global in its scope, was a series of statistical charts illustrating the condition of the descendants of former African slaves that were current residents of the US. He used statistics ranging from employment and education rates, population distributions across the nation, comparison of literacy rates between Black Americans and other countries, black ownership of property and land, and patents for black inventions to support his narrative.  

**The Limits of Data Storytelling**  

When we think about data storytelling, the key ingredients are said to be strong data, a compelling narrative, and engaging visualizations. Du Bois achieved all that in his Paris exhibit, and no doubt continued to tell this story throughout his life in his fight for social justice. Yet, here we are 120 years later and we can’t even get justice for Breonna Taylor.  

So why didn’t this narrative of black folks as human beings making progress despite tremendous hindrances stick? I think it’s a clear illustration of incentives. You can present a compelling story, but if your audience is more invested in the counter-narrative, it doesn’t matter how solid your anecdotes, how deep your data, or how beautiful and engaging your visualizations. White supremacy is a narrative that permeates our society which has allowed the exploitation of black lives and simultaneously the construction of an identity of superiority for those who can access white privilege. How can data storytelling possibly combat that? I’m not sure, but it’s obvious to me that perhaps we’ve been focused on trying to tell the wrong story and need to convey a different message.
