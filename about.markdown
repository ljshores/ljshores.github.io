### Data Scientist, lover of good food, stories, and travel.   

I'm from Chicago, born and raised, and I love my city!  
I've faced a lot of obstacles to get where I am today, and although my path into data science 
has been a winding one, there are a couple of things that have been consistent: I am curious, analytical, and strive for excellence.

I now work for Walmart helping the real estate business make critical decisions by providing them with insights and data-driven tools powered by data science.

I wanted to create this site so that I could continue to dabble in projects and learn techniques that interest me on the side, and bring some motivation to me actually finishing them! I hope that
this work will be useful or interesting to others.
